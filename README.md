# Campaign Management

This is a Next.js project built to manage and interact with campaigns. The platform allows users to view available campaigns, learn more about each campaign, and submit their participation. This project is designed using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive and user-friendly experience.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Morces/campaign_submission_tracker
cd campaign_submission_tracker
```

Then, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

### 2. Run the Development Server

After the dependencies are installed, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### 3. Start Editing

You can start editing the page by modifying the files in `app/` or `pages/`. The page auto-updates as you make changes.

## Features

- **Campaign Listing**: Displays available campaigns, each with a name, description, and a button to submit.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive interface that adjusts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Authentication**: Integrated with **NextAuth** for session management, allowing users to log in and interact with campaigns.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling, providing a clean, modern UI with utility-first classes.
